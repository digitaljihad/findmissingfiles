I was ripping a ton of music using Zspotify and found that every once in a while one or two tracks would fail so I wrote this script to scan my library to find which tracks we missing. The only known limitation is it will not catch any missing tracks that are after the last existing file. So if track 13 is missing but 12 is present, it will not catch that.
